　　I saw an interesting scene from a TV show. A girl and a boy were forced to have the blind date， and they know nothing before they came to the dinner table.
　　They felt embarrassed and after introducing each other， the girl began to speak English with the boy. The parents did not know what they were talking about， but they felt happy to see them communicating. Actually， the boy and the girl said they didn’t want this date and decided to tell their parents the truth， and they felt relieved. Mastering another language provides people more ways tocommunicate. Sometimes we can use it in the fun way.
　　Chinese is the necessary subject for students to learn. Even though some students learn Chinese all the time， they know little about Chinese culture.
　　Today， the world is crazy about learning mandarin. A lot of foreigners are interested in Chinese culture， and they learn the traditional thoughts from Chinese great minds， such as Confucious. They also learn Tai Chi and they love it. On the contrary， many Chinese students are not interested in our culture， and they feel bored to learn. We should learn and get to know our culture well.

　　Everybody knows that if we want to be successful， we must work hard. As the saying that practice makes perfect， so only hard work can bring us the result we want. Most people are easy to get frustrated when they believe that they deserve the return after making effort， however， actually， working hard won’t be surely guarantee the result we chase. But on the process of chasing our dreams， we gain the experience， which will be great helpful of future goal. There is no need to get distressed when we meet setback， because the road to success is not easy， but if we treat these experience as the treasure， then we will be happy all thetime.
　　Breakfast Breakfast is very important for us students. Many students go to school without breakfast. It is bad for our health. Food can give us energy.

I often see people pollute the environment, they pour waste water into rivers, throw rubbish, and some people cut down a lot of trees, they have no awareness of protecting the environment. When environmental pollution is serious, human beings also face great danger.

　　My hometown and Guangzhou are different in many ways. Firstly, people in Guangzhou speak several languages. For example, local citizens speak Cantonese, and the immigrants speak Mandarin. And there are many foreigners and oversea people living in Guangzhou. They mainly speak English. Once I traveled in Guangzhou, I found it a little difficult to understand Cantonese.
　　Thus I tried to communicate with them in Mandarin. Sometimes when I met some foreigners, I also chatted with them in English. However, people in my hometown always speak local dialect.
　　Finally, the environment in my hometown is polluted seriously, because of the tail gas emitted by private cars.
